1. Prepare: 
The code is developed based on Linux system 

install OpenCV
install Lua
install torch
install nngraph
install hdf5

make the alias of the "opencvLua" to compile_opencv_lua.sh in your path 

2. Process your own images
You can generate your own training dataset for the GAN model. 
Just put your clear images inside the "Clear-Images" direcotry, my code 
will generate all the corrosponding training images for you 

Put your images in the file "Your-Images"  
Delete old images in "Rain-Dataset/Testing"
In the terminal input "opencvLua Main.cpp" to compile the code 
And then input "./Main" to run the code 

You can modify the code by yourself:
change the training epoch times in train.lua
use your own images to generate your training dataset
